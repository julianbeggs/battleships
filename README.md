# BATTLESHIPS GAME

## Game Objective
The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the ships. All of the ships are somewhere on the board.  You try and hit them by guessing the coordinates of one of the squares on the board.  The board has a grid with coordinates.

## Starting a New Game
5 ships are placed randomly somewhere on the grid.  The ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally. Diagonal placement is not allowed. No part of a ship may hang off the edge of the board.  Ships may not overlap each other.

The 5 ships are:  Carrier (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2).  

## Playing the Game
The player must guess a pair of coordinates. The program responds with "hit" or "miss" as appropriate.  The grid should be marked at the guessed coordinates:  red for hit, white for miss.

When all of the squares that one ship occupies have been hit, the ship will be sunk.   The game should announce "hit and sunk" and visually indicate the players' progress.

As soon as all of the ships have been sunk, the game ends.
